## Introduction

Building a data-driven mobile app with React Native takes anywhere between several weeks to months today.

ReactiveSearch offers cross-platform UI components that work not only for iOS and Android, but also for the [web](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/tree/dev/packages/web). These UI components can further directly talk to an Elasticsearch backend with a `ReactiveBase` backend provider component.

> Much like how Bootstrap and Materialize provide scaffolding to build styles for your website, ReactiveSearch provides scaffolding to build data-driven apps.

Using it, we have been able to consistently ship apps within days, and we hope that you will build your next React Native app using ReactiveSearch.


<br />

## Features

- Works out of the box with an Elasticsearch index or appbase.io service.
- Cross-platform components - Works on both iOS and Android, with equivalent components also available for the [web](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/componentsindex.html).
- [Bring your own design components](opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/native/advanced/reactivecomponent.html) and make them work with ReactiveSearch components.
- Full theming support, components are built with primitives from NativeBase.io.
- Built with accessibility in mind, all components have an interactive playground (see an example for [DataSearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/native/components/datasearch.html#demo)), live examples and [comprehensive docs](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/native/).

## Try it out

Run this [example app with Snack Editor](https://snack.expo.io/@metagrover/booksearch) to see ReactiveSearch in action.

Or get your own app up and running in 15 mins by following the [quickstart guide](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/native/getting-started/reactivesearch.html).

## Example Apps

We have published the following apps to the App Store / Playstore.

- [Booksearch on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.booksnative): A booksearch app showing a searchable collection of over 10k books built with ReactiveSearch. [Also available as an interactive demo](https://snack.expo.io/@metagrover/booksearch).  
- [Gitxplore on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appbaseio.gitxplore): A Github repository explorer app to  search over the 25k+ most popular github repos. [Also available as an interactive demo](https://snack.expo.io/@dhruvdutt/gitxplore).  
- [ReactiveTodos on App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reactivetodos/id1347926945?mt=8): A shared collaborative to-do list app to showcase the capability of Reactivesearch. [Also available as an interactive demo](https://snack.expo.io/@dhruvdutt/todo).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions in the form of issues, PRs. Please read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/tree/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

<br />

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

The simplest way to debug the app is using [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger).
If you are having trouble running your react native app and are seeing any dependency warnings, reset cache via

```
yarn start --reset-cache
```

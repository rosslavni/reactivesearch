## Introduction

Gone are those days, when it used to take several weeks or months to build and ship meaningful apps. With ReactiveSearch Native, you can ship mobile apps in days and sometimes, even a few hours.

ReactiveSearch provides scaffolding to build data-driven apps. This library bundles a range of React Native UI components that are built with extendibility in mind: You can customize the backend queries, define how the components react to changes, extend the styles with theming and style injection support.

> Above all, we've kept the components API exactly the same as that of reactivesearch for web, enabling you to write once and use everywhere.

<br />

## Features

- Works on both iOS and Android
- Extendible architecture - enabling you to build your own custom components
- Full theming support with NativeBase.io
- Consistent API with [Reactivesearch for web](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch)
- Easy Customisation support in-built

<br />

## Try it out

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

The simplest way to debug the app is using [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger).
If you are having trouble running your react native app and are seeing any dependency warnings, reset cache via 

```
yarn start --reset-cache
```

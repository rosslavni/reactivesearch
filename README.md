## 1. ReactiveSearch: Intro

ReactiveSearch is a React UI components library for Elasticsearch. It has 25+ components for Lists, Dropdowns, RangeSliders, DataSearch, MultiLevelMenu, Calendars, Feeds, RatingsFilter, ResultCard and ResultList.

The library is conceptually divided into two parts:  

1. Sensor components and
2. Actuator components.

Each sensor component is purpose built for applying a specific filter on the data. For example:

* A `SingleList` sensor component applies an exact match filter based on the selected item.
* A `RangeSlider` component applies a numeric range query based on the values selected from the UI.
* A `RatingsFilter` component conveniently applies a ‚òÖ ratings filter on a dataset containing ratings like data.

Sensor components can be configured to create a combined query context and render the matching results via an actuator component.

**ReactiveSearch** primarily comes with two actuators: `ResultCard` and `ResultList`. ResultCard displays the results in a card interface whereas ResultList displays them in a list. Both provide built-in support for pagination and infinite scroll views.

Besides these, the library also provides low level actuators (ReactiveElement, ReactiveList) to render in a more customized fashion.

## 2. Features

### Design

* The sensor / actuator design pattern allows creating complex UIs where any number of sensors can be chained together to reactively update an actuator (or even multiple actuators).
* The library handles the transformation of the UI interactions into database queries. You only need to include the components and associate each with a DB field.
* Built in live updates - Actuators can be set to update results even when the underlying data changes in the DB.
* Comes with a cleanly namespaced CSS classes API that allows extending built-in styles without hassle.
* Is themable via `ThemeProvider`.


### Ease of Use

* One step installation with [npm install @appbaseio/reactivesearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/v1/getting-started/reactivesearch.html),
* A UMD build that works directly in the browser. Installation steps [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/reactivesearch.html#reactivesearch-as-umd),
* Styled and scoped components that can be easily extended,
* See the [reactivesearch starter app](https://github.com/appbaseio-apps/reactivesearch-starter-app).

## 3. Component Playground

Try the live component playground at [playground](https://opensource.appbase.io/playground/?filterBy=ReactiveSearch&selectedKind=s%2FRatingsFilter&selectedStory=Basic&full=0&down=1&left=1&panelRight=0&downPanel=kadirahq%2Fstorybook-addon-knobs). Look out for the knobs section in the playground part of the stories to tweak each prop and see the effects.

## 5. Installation

Installing ReactiveSearch is just one command.

```javascript
npm install --save @appbaseio/reactivesearch
```

You can also read about it [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/reactivesearch.html).


## 6. Getting Started

Follow the getting started guide to build a Hello Search! app from the official docs [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/getting-started/reactivesearch.html).

## 7. Docs Manual

The official docs for the library are at [https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual).

The components are divided into four sections:
* Generic UI components are at [reactive-manual/base-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/base-components/).
* List based UI components are at [reactive-manual/list-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/list-components/).
* Range based UI components are at [reactive-manual/range-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/range-components/).
* Search UI components are at [reactive-manual/search-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/search-components/).
* Result components are at [reactive-manual/result-components](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactive-manual/result-components/).

## 8. Developing Locally


1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch.git
```

2. `cd` into the project directory

3. Checkout the `dev` branch (should be default)

4. fetch the submodules. In case you don't have `ssh` setup for github, change the URLs in `.gitmodules` to use `https` instead

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule sync
git submodule update --remote
```

5. The submodules will be fetched into `/packages`. Defaults to `dev` in `/packages/playground` and `master` in `/packages/reactivecore`.

- [**ReactiveMaps**](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivemaps) is a similar project to Reactive Search that allows building realtime maps easily.

- [**appbase-js**](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) While building search UIs is dandy with Reactive Search, you might also need to add some input forms. **appbase-js** comes in handy there.

- [**dejavu**](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu) allows viewing raw data within an appbase.io (or Elasticsearch) app. **Soon to be released feature:** An ability to import custom data from CSV and JSON files, along with a guided walkthrough on applying data mappings.

- [**mirage**](https://github.com/appbaseio/mirage) ReactiveSearch components can be extended using custom Elasticsearch queries. For those new to Elasticsearch, Mirage provides an intuitive GUI for composing queries.
